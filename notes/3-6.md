The sequence

1 2 3 4 5 …

is normal in base 10.

Conj 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 … is too.

Copeload & Erdos 1946:

Yep, just because the primes are **dense enough**.

Idea: A set of positive integers is "small" if the sum of the reciprocals of its elements is finite.

For each set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^+$, let

$$ s \in [0, \infty)$, let $S_A(s) = \sum_{n \in A} n^{-s}$$

(1)

We have

$$ 0 < Dim_3(A) \le 1$$

(2)

always.

We have the following properties of dimension:

1. Monotonicity: If $A \subseteq B$, then $Dim_3(A) \le Dim_3(B)$.
2. Stability: $Dim_3(A \cup B) = \max(Dim_3(A), Dim_3(B))$.
3. Translation invariance: For each $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $Dim_3(A + k) = Dim_3(A)$.
4. Exponential invariance: For each $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $Dim_3(kA) = Dim_3(A)$.

We can write (1) as

$$S_A(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty f(n) n^{-s}$$

(3)

where $f$ is the characteristic function of $A$.

In the terminology of analytic number theory, (2) says that $Dim_3(A)$ is the abscissa of convergence of the series (3). In this sense, 3-demension was introduced by Dirichlet in 1837.

Theorem (entropy characterization of 3-demension - Cahen 1894)

$$Dim_3(A) = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log |A_n\{1,\ldots,n\}|}{\log n}$$
