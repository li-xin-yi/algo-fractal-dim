${\cal X} = \{0, 1\}$
$ P(1) = \beta$
$ {\cal H}(B) = H({\cal X}, \beta)$

Let ${\cal X} = I^k$, where each $I$ is $(0,1)$ or $[0,1]$. If $g: {\cal X} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\vec{alpha} = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k)\in {\cal X}$, then we sometimes use "$g(\vec{\alpha})$" as en abbreviation for randum variable $\xi: \{0, 1\}^* \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\xi(1) = g(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k)$ and $\xi(0) = g(\alpha_1, \ldots, 1 - \alpha_k)$. If $\beta \in [0,1]$, then we also use $\beta$ as an abbreviation for the prob measure $p$ in \{0, 1\}^ in $p(1) = \beta$. Thus, for example, $E_{\beta}g(\vec{\alpha}) = \beta g(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k) + (1 - \beta)g(\alpha_1, \ldots, 1 - \alpha_k)$ is the expected value of "the random variable $g(\vec{\alpha})$ under with respect to "the probablity measure $\beta$. In practice, Shannon's binary entropy function ${\cal H}: [0,1] \to [0, \infty)$ is often used to measure the uncertainty of a random variable. For $\beta \in [0,1]$, we define ${\cal H}(\beta) = -\beta \log \beta - (1 - \beta) \log (1 - \beta)$, where we use the convention that $0 \log 0 = 0$. The function ${\cal H}$ is concave, and ${\cal H}(0) = {\cal H}(1) = 0$. The function ${\cal H}$ is also the unique function $h: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ is defined by

$$ {\cal H}(\beta) = E\_{\beta}\log \frac{1}{p}$$

with the provise that $0 \log \frac{1}{0} = 0$. So that ${\cal H}$ is continuous.

Similarly, the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence function $D: [0,1] \times [0,1] \to [0, \infty)$ is defined by

$$D(\beta \parallel  \alpha) = E_{\beta} \log \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$$

_(the divergence of $\beta$ from $\alpha$)_

with the proviso that $0 \log \frac{0}{p} = 0$, so that $D$ is continuous.

Note:

$H(\beta) = -\beta \log \beta - (1 - \beta) \log (1 - \beta)$

$D(\beta \parallel  \alpha) = \beta \log \frac{\beta}{\alpha} + (1 - \beta) \log \frac{1 - \beta}{1 - \alpha}$

Well-known: $D(\beta \parallel  \alpha) \ge 0$ with equality iff $\beta = \alpha$.

Lemma 7.3 For all $\beta \in [0,1]$,

$adim(FREQ_{\beta}) = {\cal H}(\beta)$ (algo dimension)

Proof: Let $\beta \in [0, 1]$, and let $S$ be a rational number that $S > {\cal H}(\beta)$. It suffices to show that $adim(FREQ_{\beta}) \le S$.

Let $\epsilon = \frac{S - {\cal H}(\beta)}{4}$, for a rational number $r \in (0, 1)$ such that $D(\beta \parallel  r) < \epsilon$.
