- randomness -> p-randomness -> positive p-randomness

- no k-complexity chain of measure & dimension in complexity classes.

  - k^t complexity

- The good news: sizes of complexity cores and numbers have been used as proxies for k^t complexity to apply measure to complexity problems.
- The very good news: this hasn't been done for dimension.
