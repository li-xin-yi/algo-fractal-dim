Theorem For every $s \in [0, 1]$, there is a Hawel basis $B$ of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ with $dim_H(B) = s$.

For $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we write $span(B)$ for the linear space of $B$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., the set of linear combinations

$$x = \sim_{u \in I} g(u) u$$

where $I \subseteq \mathbb{B}$ is finite and $g: I \to \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0\}$ for each $s \in [0, 1]$, we have by known methods a set $C_s \subseteq [0,1]$ with the following properties:

1. $dim_H(C_s) = s$
2. For all oracles $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ that computes the set
   $$ D^A = \{x \in C_s | dim^A(x) = s\}$$
   has the condition of the continuous
3. $span(C_s) = \mathbb{R}$

Proof. Let $s \in [0,1]$, and let $C_s$ be as above. Let

$$(x_\alpha | \alpha < 2^{\aleph_0})$$

be a well-ordering of $C_s$, and let

$$((A_\beta, y_\beta) | \beta < 2^{\aleph_0})$$

be a well-ordering of the set

$$D = \{(A, y) \in {\cal P}(\mathbb{N}) \times C_s | s \le_T A \wedge dim^A(y) = s\}$$

Define the sequence

$(u_r | r \in \mathbb{N})$ of real numbers by the following transfinite recursion. Given $r < 2^{\aleph_0}$, let
$$B_r = \{u_s  | s < r\}$$
write $r = \xi + k$, where $\xi$ is 0 or a limit ordinal and $k < \mathbb{N}$. Call $r$ even/odd if $k$ is even/odd.

1. If $r = \xi + 2k$ is even, let $u_r = y_\beta$, where $\beta$ is the best ordinal such that $A_\beta = A_{\xi + k}$ and $y_\beta \notin span(B_{r})$.
2. If $r$ is odd, let $u_r = x_\alpha$ be the first element of $C_s \setminus span(B_r)$.

To see that this is a well defined, let $r < 2^{\aleph_0}$. Then $|B_r| < 2^{\aleph_0}$, so $span(B_r) < 2^{\aleph_0}$.Since $|D| = |C_s| = 2^{\aleph_0}$, it follows that $u_r$ exists.

Let $B = \{u_r | r < 2^{\aleph_0}\}$. The
rest of this proof establishes that $B$ is a Hawel basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that $dim_H(B) = s$.

We first show that $span(B) = \mathbb{R}$. Since $span(C_s) = \mathbb{R}$, it suffices to show that $C_s \subseteq span(B)$, i.e., that the set $E = span(B) \setminus C_s$ is empty. To this end, let $x$ be a lower bound of $E$ in our well-ordering of $C_s$.
