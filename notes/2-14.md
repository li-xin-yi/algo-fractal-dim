- A prefix set is a language $A \subseteq \{0, 1\}^*$ such that for all $x, y \in \{0, 1\}^*$, if $x \sqsubseteq y \rightarrow x = y$
  i.e., no element of $A$ is a prefix of another element of $A$.

Let $P_\text{pref} = \{i \in \mathbb{N} \vert \text{dom}(\phi_i) \text{ is a prefix set}\}$

This is an I/O property of programs, because membership depends only by $\phi_i$, not on any other feature of $m_i$.

**Theorem** $P_\text{pref}$ is computably enforceable.

**proof**: Given an input algorithm (TM) $m_i$,

let $m_{f(i)}$ be the following algorithm:

> input $x \in \{0, 1\}^*$
> dovetail computation of $m_i(y)$ for all $y \in \{0, 1\}^*$. keeping track of the set ($S$) of $y$'s such that $m_i(y)$ has halted. If at some stage an $m_i(z)$ is about to halt for $z$ a proper prefix or proper extension of an element of $S$, run forever. If $m_i(x)$ is discovered to have halted before this, output $\phi_i(x)$.

union of two computably enforceable properties is computably enforceable? => not sure

Hausdorff's dimension (1919) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space (Picture this as $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ and $d$ is the Euclidean distance). Let $s \in [0, \infty)$ and each $E \subseteq X$, the s-dimensional Hausdorff (outer) measure of $E$ at grid size $\delta$ is defined as

$$
H^s_\delta(E) = \inf \left\{ \sum_{u \in C}
 \text{diam}(u)^s \vert E \subseteq \bigcup_{u \in C} u, \text{each diam}(u) < \delta \right\}
$$

- $diam(u) = \sup_{x, y \in u} d(x, y)$
