An enforcer of an I/O property ($P \subseteq \mathbb{N}$) of a program is a function _(map TM to TM)_ $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the following two conditions hold for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$:

1. $f(i) \in P$
2. $i \in P \Rightarrow \phi_{f(i)} = \phi_i$ _(don't change the input/output behavior)_

An I/O property of programs is computably enforceable if it has an enforcer that is computable.

**homework problem 5**: prove that the property $P = \{i \vert |dom(\phi_i)| \le 3 \}$ is computably enforceable.

**Question** what I/O properties of a program are computably enforceable?
