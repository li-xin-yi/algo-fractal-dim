A real number $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ is computable if the constant function $$K_{\alpha}: \{0, 1\}^* \to \mathbb{R}$$ $$K_{\alpha}(t) = \alpha$$ is computable.

Fix a stanard enumeration $M_0, M_1, M_2, \ldots$ of all TMs with inputs and outputs in $\mathbb{N}$.

The (diagonal) halting problem is the set $$K = \{k | M_k(k) \downarrow\}$$

It is well known that $K$ is computably enumerable (c.e.) but not decidable.

**homework problem 2**: prove that a function: $f: \{0, 1\}^* \to \mathbb{R}$ is computable if and only if its lower graph

$$
G \bar (f) = \{(w, q) \in \{0,1\}^* \times Q | q < f(w)\}
$$

is computably enumerable.

**homework problem 3**: prove the real number $\alpha_K = \sum_{k \in K} \frac{1}{(k+1)^2}$ is lower semicomputable but not computable.

(Note: The young Euler first became famous by proving that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$)

**homework problem 4**: prove that a probability measure $p$ on $\{0, 1\}^*$ is computable if and only if and only if it is lower semicomputable.

For each $i \in \mathbb{N}$, let $\phi_i$ be the partial computable function computed by $M_i$. ($\phi_i = f_{M_i}$)

A property of programs is a set $P \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

An I/O property of programs is a property $P$ of programs that satisfies if $$ \phi_i = \phi_j \Rightarrow [i \in P \Leftrightarrow j \in P]$$

(if they have the same input/output behavior, then either both or neither are in the property.)

A property $P$ of programs is trivial if $P = \mathbb{N}$ or $P = \emptyset$. Otherwise, $P$ is nontrivial.

An enforcer of an I/O property $P$ is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that the following two conditions hold for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$:

1. $f(i) \in P$
2. $i \in P \Rightarrow \phi_i = \phi_{f(i)}$

**homework problem 5**: prove that $P = \{i \vert |dom(\phi_i)| \le 3 \}$ is computably enforceable.
