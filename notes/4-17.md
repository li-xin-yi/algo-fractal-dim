A group is an ordered pair $(G, \star)$ where $G$ is a set and $\star$ is a binary operation on $G$ ($\star: G \times G \to G$) satisfying:

1. $a \star (b \star c) = (a \star b) \star c$
2. $(\exists e \in G)(\forall a \in G)(e \star a = a \star e = a)$
3. $(\forall a \in G)(\exists a^{-1} \in G)(a \star a^{-1} = a^{-1} \star a = e)$

A group is abelian if $\star$ is commutative.

An additive group is a commutative group $(G, +)$.

A vector group $V$ on a field $F$ is an additive group together with a scalar multiplication operation:

$$ F \times V \to V $$
$$ (a, v) \mapsto a v $$

1. $a(bv) = (ab)v$
2. $a(v + w) = av + aw$
3. $(a + b)v = av + bv$

Fact. Every vector space has a basis. $B$

Every $v \in V$ is a (finite) linear combination of elements of $B$.

$0$ is not a linear combination of any elements of $B$.

$\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Hawel 1905. Every Hawel basis has the cardinality of the continuum.

Siexprinski 1920l Every Hb has inner Lebesgue measure 0.

So if measurable, the measure 0.

For every $0 \le s \le 1$, there is a Hawel basis $B$ s.t. $dim(B) = s$.
